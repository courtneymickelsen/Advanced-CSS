          For example, say your developers have come up with the perfect amortization
          program and you want to install it on the workgroup server for other 
          systems to remotely mount and use. Because this is a third-party or custom 
          application, the logical place for it is in <span class="monospace">/usr/local/appname</span>, possibly with a 
          link to the program binary in the <span class="monospace">/usr/local/bin</span> directory (because that's in 
          the path).
        </p>

        <div class="alert-div">
          <h3 class="alert-heading">Alert</h3>
          <p class="alert-p">
            If given a choice between putting the software package <span class="bold cap">bigprog</span> in the 
            <span class="bold">/usr/local/<span class="cap">bigprog</span></span> section and the <span class="bold">/opt/<span class="cap">bigprog</span></span> section, it's hard to choose. Read 
            any relevant exam question closely--the main difference being that the <span class="bold">/opt</span> section 
            is not considered to be sharable, whereas the <span class="bold">/usr</span> section is often shared and mounted 
            by client systems.

        <h1>File Management Commands</h1>
        <p>
          A major section of the 101 exam is dedicated to how to run commands properly 
          with the right options and arguments. As a good sysadmin, you'll be 
          expected to know how to create, delete, edit, set permissions on, display, 
          move, copy, and determine the type of files and programs.
        </p>

        <div class="alert-div">
          <h3 class="alert-heading">Alert</h3>
          <p class="alert-p">
            You must be able to pick proper and working commands out of lists of possibilities, 
            type in appropriate strings in fill-in-the-blank boxes, and in general show that you've 
            run the programs and utilities in question.

        <h2>Tips for Working with Linux Files</h2>
        <p>
          Because most users and sysadmins come from a Windows or other OS background, 
          a quick set of recommendations for the less-experienced can be of 
          help here:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">> Hidden files aren't really hidden</span> - They just begin with a ., such as 
            the <span class="monospace">.bashrc</span> and <span class="monospace">.bash_profile<span class="monospace"></span> files. These are not viewable by normal 
            users with conventional commands and switches and aren't deleted by 
            commands such as <span class="monospace">rm -f *.*</span>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">> Filenames can contain multiple periods or no period characters</span> - 
            The filenames <span class="monospace">this.is.a.long.file</span> and <span class="monospace">thisisalongfile</span> are perfectly reasonable 
            and possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">> Spaces in filenames look nice, but are a pain to type </span>- Use an _ or a 
            - instead of spaces because it's neater and easier than prefixing all spaces 
            with a \. (To display a space in a filename, the system shows a space 
            prefixed with a backslash.)
          </li>
        </ul>
